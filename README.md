# Socratic Worldbuilding System
A system for creating one-page tabletop roleplaying games.

## Introduction
Socratic Worldbuilding System (SWS) games are about disruptive change.
In an SWS game, the players portray characters who have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by such a change.
By answering a series of questions about the nature of the disruptive change, they will describe the world in which the game is set.

All SWS games are comprised of the same small collection of concepts.
In the following sections, we will use three SWS games as running examples to illustrate each such concept.
The example games are: Staff Meeting, Parliament of Dragons, and Kill the Beast.
Complete versions of all three example games can be found in the appendices to this rulebook.

## Setting
A setting is a description of the world in which the events of a story will take place.
In an SWS game, the setting should provide a rough sketch of the world that the characters inhabit.
The players will fill in the details of the game's setting as they play the game.

### Examples
  - Staff Meeting: A fantastical school of witchcraft and wizardry.
  - Parliament of Dragons: A continent ruled by territorial dragons.
  - Kill the Beast: A rural village on the edge of a mysterious forest.

## Disruptive Change
A disruptive change is something that changes some aspect of the setting.
This change is something that will significantly affect the players' characters.

### Examples of Disruptive Changes
  - Staff Meeting: Students have recently started using staffs to augment their magical abilities.
  - Parliament of Dragons: A group of humans have arrived from overseas and are establishing new colonies.
  - Kill the Beast: A local farmer claims to have seen a monster lurking in the woods.

## Characters
The characters are the people that the players will portray for the duration of the game.
Each player will portray one character throughout the game.
In an SWS game, the characters have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by the game's disruptive change.

### Examples of Characters
  - Staff Meeting: Professors who are preparing the curriculum for the upcoming school year.
  - Parliament of Dragons: Ancient wyrms who have long vied for dominance.
  - Kill the Beast: Villagers whose work requires them to venture into the forest.

## Topics
Every SWS game features four topics that the players' characters have gathered to discuss.
Each topic addresses one aspect of the setting that will be affected by the disruptive change.
Each character has two topics of interest.
A character's final score is based on how prominently their topics of intereste are in the discussion during the course of the game.

### Examples of Topics
  - Staff Meeting: Educational Outcomes, Academic Integrity, Facilities & Logistics, Equal Opportunity
  - Parliament of Dragons: Treasure, Renown, Food, Territory
  - Kill the Beast: Public Safety, Stewardship, Politics, Economics

## Journalistic Questions
In every SWS game, there are a set of questions about the nature of the disruptive change that the players will answer.
All of the questions should be open-ended.
That is, none of the questions should be presented with a menu of possible answers.
The players are encouraged to invent details about the setting as needed to answer each question.

The number of journalistic questions can be adjusted to accommodate the playstyle of a given group.
As a general rule, one (for shorter games) or two (for longer games) journalistic question per player should be sufficient.

### Examples of Journalistic Questions
  - Staff Meeting:
    - Who can use a staff?
    - What can staffs do?
    - Why do people use staffs?
    - Where do people use/acquire staffs?
    - When do people use/acquire staffs?
  - Parliament of Dragons:
    - Who are the colonists?
    - What are the colonists capable of doing?
    - Why are the colonists here?
    - Where did the colonists come from?
    - When did the colonists arrive?
  - Kill the Beast:
    - Who has seen the monster?
    - What evidence about the monster has been found?
    - Why is the monster encroaching on the village?
    - Where has the monster been spotted?
    - When has the monster been spotted?

## Creating an SWS Game
To create a new SWS game, you will do the following:
  1. Describe the setting.
  2. Describe the disruptive change that will alter that setting.
  3. Describe the characters that the players will portray.
  4. Choose the topics that the characters have gathered to discuss.
  5. Allocate two topics of particular interest to each character. 
  6. Choose a set of journalistic questions to answer during the game.


## Gameplay
All SWS games take place over a series of turns.
On each turn, one player will serve as the active player. 
The active player will start each turn by choosing an unanswered journalistic question and answering it.

Next, the other players should ask a series of follow-up questions about the active player's answer.
These follow-up questions should elicit more details from the active player and encourage them to think critically about the wider implications of their answer.
Via this process of Socratic questioning, the players will describe the game's setting and how it has been affected by the game's disruptive change.

Finally, when everyone is ready to move on, the active player will choose someone else to bserve as the active player for the next round.
Whenever possible, the active player must choose someone who has served as the active player fewer times than themselves.
The game ends when all of the journalistic questions have been answered.

### Keeping Score
At the end of each round, the players will assign scores to the game's topics based on how prominently they feel like they featured in that round's discussion.
These scores should be made independently and should remain confidential until the end of the game.

When scoring a round, each player should disribute a total of ten points amongst the game's four topics.
Players should assign four points to the most prominent topic, three points to the second most prominent topic, two points to the thrid most prominent topic, and one point to the least prominent topic during the discussion in that round.

At the end of the game, the players should compute a total score for each topic.
To do so, they should add up the scores that all of the players gave to each topic at the end of each round.
Then, each player should compute the final score for their character.
A character's final score is the sum of the total scores for that character's two topics of interest.

### Socratic Questioning
Test 
  - Clarifying concepts
  - Challenging assumptions
  - Probing rationale and evidence
  - Predicting implications and consequences
  - Exploring alternative viewpoints
