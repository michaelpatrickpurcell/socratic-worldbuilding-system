# Socratic Worldbuilding System
A system for creating one-page tabletop roleplaying games.

## Introduction
Socratic Worldbuilding System (SWS) games are about disruptive change. In an SWS game, the players portray characters who have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by such a change. By answering a series of questions about the nature of the disruptive change, they will describe the world in which the game is set.

### Examples of Settings
