# Socratic Worldbuilding System
A system for creating one-page tabletop roleplaying games.

## Introduction
All Socratic Worldbuilding System (SWS) games are about some kind of disruptive change. In an SWS game, the players portray characters who have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by such a change. The players will ask, and then answer, a series of questions about the nature of the disruptive change and how their characters have been affected by it. By so doing, the players will indirectly describe various aspects of the world in which the game is set.

### Examples of Disruptive Changes
  - Staff Meeting: At a wizards' school, students have recently started using staffs to augment their magical abilities.
  - Parliament of Dragons: In a world ruled by territorial dragons, a group of humans have arrived and started to build new colonies.
  - Kill the Beast: In a rural town, several people have gone missing and a local farmer claims to have seen a monster lurking in the woods nearby.
