# Socratic Worldbuilding System
A system for creating semi-competitive tabletop roleplaying games.

## Introduction
Socratic Worldbuilding System (SWS) games are about disruptive change.
In an SWS game, the players portray characters who have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by such a change.
By answering a series of questions about the nature of the disruptive change, they will describe the world in which the game is set.

We will use three running examples to demonstrate how to use these rules to create an SWS game.
In each section, we will show how the concepts discussed in that section are used in each of the three example games.
The example games are: Staff Meeting, Parliament of Dragons, and Kill the Beast.
Complete versions of all three example games can be found in the appendices to this rulebook.

## Setting
A setting is a description of the world in which the events of a story will take place.
In an SWS game, the setting should provide a rough sketch of the world that the players' characters inhabit.
The players will fill in the details as they play the game.

### Examples
  - Staff Meeting: A fantastical school of witchcraft and wizardry.
  - Parliament of Dragons: A wild continent ruled by territorial dragons.
  - Kill the Beast: A rural village on the edge of a mysterious forest.
