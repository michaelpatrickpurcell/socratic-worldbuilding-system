# Socratic Worldbuilding System
A system for creating one-page tabletop roleplaying games.

## Introduction
Socratic Worldbuilding System (SWS) games are about disruptive change.
In an SWS game, the players portray characters who have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by such a change.
By answering a series of questions about the nature of the disruptive change, they will describe the world in which the game is set.

We will use three running examples to demonstrate how to use these rules to create an SWS game.
In each section, we will show how the concepts discussed in that section are used in each of the three example games.
The example games are: Staff Meeting, Parliament of Dragons, and Kill the Beast.
Complete versions of all three example games can be found in the appendices to this rulebook.

<!-- To create a new SWS game, follow the steps you will do the following:
  1. Describe a Setting.
  2. Describe a Disruptive Change to that Setting
  3. Describe the Characters that the players will portray.
  4. Describe the Topics that the characters have gathered to discuss. -->

## Setting
A setting is a description of the world in which the events of a story will take place.
In an SWS game, the setting should provide a rough sketch of the world that the characters inhabit.
The players will fill in the details of the game's setting as they play the game.

### Examples
  - Staff Meeting: A fantastical school of witchcraft and wizardry.
  - Parliament of Dragons: A continent ruled by territorial dragons.
  - Kill the Beast: A rural village on the edge of a mysterious forest.

## Disruptive Change
A disruptive change is something that changes some aspect of the setting.
This change is something that will significantly affect the players' characters.

### Examples of Disruptive Changes
  - Staff Meeting: Students have recently started using staffs to augment their magical abilities.
  - Parliament of Dragons: A group of humans have arrived from overseas and are establishing new colonies.
  - Kill the Beast: A local farmer claims to have seen a monster lurking in the woods.

## Characters
Each player will portray one character throughout the game.
The characters have gathered to discuss the ways in which they have been affected by the game's disruptive change.

### Examples of Characters
  - Staff Meeting: Professors who are preparing the curriculum for the upcoming school year.
  - Parliament of Dragons: Ancient wyrms who have long vied for dominance.
  - Kill the Beast: Villagers whose work requires them to venture into the forest.

## Topics
Every SWS game features four topics that the players' characters have gathered to discuss.
Each topic addresses one aspect of the setting that will be affected by the disruptive change.
Each character is particularly interested in discussing two of the four themes.

### Examples of Topics
  - Staff Meeting: Educational Outcomes, Academic Integrity, Facilities & Logistics, Equal Opportunity
  - Parliament of Dragons: Treasure, Renown, Food, Territory
  - Kill the Beast: Public Safety, Stewardship, Politics, Economics

## Questions
In every SWS game, there are five questions about the nature of the disruptive change that the players will answer.
All of the questions are open-ended, and the players will invent details about the setting as needed to answer them.

### Examples of Journalistic Questions
  - Staff Meeting:
    - Who can use a staff?
    - What can staffs do?
    - Why do people use staffs?
    - Where do people use/acquire staffs?
    - When do people use/acquire staffs?
  - Parliament of Dragons:
    - Who are the colonists?
    - What are the colonists capable of doing?
    - Why are the colonists here?
    - Where did the colonists come from?
    - When did the colonists arrive?
  - Kill the Beast:
    - Who has seen the monster?
    - What evidence about the monster has been found?
    - Why is the monster encroaching on the village?
    - Where has the monster been spotted?
    - When has the monster been spotted?

## Gameplay
The game takes place over several turns.
On each turn, one player will be the active player.
The active player will choose one of the unanswered questions about the game's disruptive change and answer it.
Then, other players should ask a series of follow-up questions about the active player's answer.
Via this process of Socratic questioning, the players will gradually describe the game's setting and how that setting has been affected by the game's disruptive change.
When everyone is ready to move on, the active player will choose someone who has not yet served as the active player to be the active player for the next round.
The game ends when all of the questions about the game's disruptive change have been answered.

### Socratic Questioning
  - Clarifying concepts
  - Challenging assumptions
  - Probing rationale and evidence
  - Predicting implications and consequences
  - Exploring alternative viewpoints
